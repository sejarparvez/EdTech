# Single Page React App with Vite and TypeScript

## Overview

This is a single-page application (SPA) built using React, Vite, and TypeScript. The app is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to develop and deploy. Vite is used as the build tool, providing a highly performant development environment, and TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the codebase.

## Features

- ⚡️ Fast development with Vite
- 🛠️ Type-safe development with TypeScript
- 🌟 Modern React with hooks and functional components
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS
